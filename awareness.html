            <h1><u>Mental Health Conditions</u></h1>
            <p>There are many mental health conditions. Few of them are discussed here</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>
                    <h3><b>Anxiety Disorders</b></h3>

                <dd>
                    <p>Anxiety disorders are characterised by excessive fear and worry and related
                        behavioural disturbances.
                        Symptoms are severe enough to result in significant
                        distress or significant impairment in functioning.</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    <h3><b>Depression</b></h3>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Depression is different from usual mood fluctuations and short-lived
                        emotional responses to challenges in everyday life.</p>
                    <p>During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable,
                        empty)
                        or a loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly
                        every day, for at least two weeks.</p>
                    <p>Several other symptoms are also present,
                        which may include poor concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or low
                        self-worth, hopelessness about the future, thoughts about dying or suicide,
                        disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and feeling especially tired
                        or low in energy. </p>
                    <p>People with depression are at an increased risk of
                        suicide.</p>
                </dd>

                </dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>People with bipolar disorder experience alternating depressive episodes with
                        periods of manic symptoms.</p>
                    <p>During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable,
                        empty) or a
                        loss of pleasure or interest in activities, for most of the day, nearly
                        every day. </p>
                    <p>Manic symptoms may include euphoria or irritability, increased
                        activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased talkativeness,
                        racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased need for sleep,
                        distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour.</p>
                    <p>People with bipolar disorder are at an increased risk of suicide.</p>

                    <h3><b>Schizophrenia</b></h3>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>People with schizophrenia have a life expectancy 10-20 years below that
                        of the general population (4).</p>
                    <p>Schizophrenia is characterised by significant impairments in perception and changes in behaviour.
                    </p>
                    <p>Symptoms may include persistent delusions, hallucinations, disorganised
                        thinking, highly disorganised behaviour, or extreme agitation.</p>
                    <p>People with schizophrenia may experience persistent difficulties with their cognitive
                        functioning.</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>
                    <h3><b>Eating Disorders</b></h3>
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa,
                        involve abnormal eating and preoccupation with food as well as prominent
                        body weight and shape concerns.</p>
                    <p>The symptoms or behaviours result in
                        significant risk or damage to health, significant distress, or
                        significant impairment of functioning.</p>
                    <p>Anorexia nervosa often has its onset during adolescence or early adulthood and is associated with
                        premature death due to medical complications or suicide.</p>
                    <p> Individuals with bulimia nervosa are at a significantly increased risk for substance
                        use, suicidality, and health complications. </p>
