            <h1>Sahar’s experience</h1>
            <img src="assets/sahar.png" alt="Sahar's picture" style="width:300px; height:300px;">

            <p>"I was 16 when my life was turned upside down by an invisible illness. I spent what should have been my
                senior year in high school on a couch, too depressed to move, eat, or think, in a maelstrom of internal
                terror that I hoped would go away. It never did.
                I spent years living with an undiagnosed mental illness. All I knew was I was hurting and terrified that
                people would find out about my mental struggle.
                I didn’t know anyone who was open about having
                a mental illness. I turned to drugs and alcohol to numb my pain. My life didn’t matter to me and I had a
                suicide attempt.
                It has been eleven years since my world fell apart.
                In that time I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, major depressive disorder, and
                obsessive compulsive disorder. I have dealt with the perils of addiction. Today I am taking prescribed
                medication, attending therapy sessions, and putting in the work be mentally healthy.
                Over those eleven years I also broke out of my bubble of shame and realized that my illness was a
                superpower I could use to help others. I cofounded a non-profit organization aimed at bringing awareness
                to mental health and used my story to create awareness and help others. I am proud to be a mental health
                advocate. Giving people hope by sharing my story has been the greatest pleasure of my life. Maybe that
                is what all the heart ache and suffering is for – to help others.
                As much as my illness is a superpower I have days where I am crippled by my illness. I am lucky to have
                an incredible support system that helps me through the darkness. This is not something I take for
                granted. Many people have no support and no access to good mental health care. They are left to suffer
                and in some cases perish from something that is treatable.
                To move forward we must ensure that mental health care is accessible to all. We must ensure that our
                kids are taught that it is ok not to be ok and help is just
                a conversation away. Mental illness is not a death sentence nor a sign of weakness.
                My name is Sahar. I am a proud mentally ill teacher, advocate, daughter, niece, friend, aunt, dog-mom,
                and human, finding my way in the world like everyone else."</p>

            <h1>Anjali's Story</h1>
            <img src="assets/anjali.png" style="width:300px; height:300px;">

            <p>I have dealt with mental health difficulties since the age of 11.
                I began receiving support for my disordered eating, self-harm, depression, and
                anxiety when I was 13 years old. This consisted of a lot of therapy and
                individual work and now I can happily say I am recovered. I continue working
                on myself every day to create a life I know I deserve.
                My recovery journey began at 13 years old when I finally realised something had
                to change because I was so sick of the way I was feeling every day. As a young
                girl, I’d always been a passionate person to strive for success and when I
                realised that I needed to receive help so I can stop holding myself back and
                reach my goals, I slowly began responding to therapy. Choosing recovery was the
                best decision I made. I learnt so much more about myself and began falling in
                love with myself and the world, without being so critical of everything.
                Making the choice to wake up every day and at least try to be kind to myself is
                what allowed me to now be here today helping others.
                Recovery is invaluable. Although the journey is long and consists of many ups
                and downs, finding the inner strength to push forward and finding reason to keep
                fighting is so fulfilling.
                My message for young people is to not pressurise yourself to think ‘you should be
                better by now’ I know I fell into that trap a lot, but when I was able to be patient
                with myself and be kind to myself for taking things at my own pace, that’s when I saw the
                most progress. Take your time, don’t lose hope, all the small steps you take will take you
                far. On the hard days, show even more kindness to yourself and surround yourself with your
                support system.

            <h1>Jamie's Story</h1> <!--https://www.seemescotland.org/stigma-discrimination/personal-stories/personal-stories/jamies-story-->
            <img src="assets/Jamie.png" alt="Jamie's picture" style="width:300px; height:300px;">
            <p>I didn't discuss it with anyone. The only time I'd really hear of anything similar to what I was going
                through was on daytime television, where you'd see someone who would be looked upon as a very poor
                example, and I didn't want to feel like that. That led into my feelings of shame, and so I just kept
                everything under wraps. I didn't tell anyone.
                It is quite a typical masculine thing – you've got a problem, you just deal with it yourself. But I
                realised just how negative an impact that was having on my life. The more I bottled up, the less I
                talked about it, the bigger problem it became.
                The day that things started to get better was the day I went up to my mum and said, ‘Mum, I've got a
                problem here, there's something going on, I've got an issue.’
            </p>

            <p>So much of my life was controlled by anxiety.
                When I first spoke about it, it felt like a weight off my shoulders. The moment I talked about it, I
                also started losing the stigma over it. And every extra person I told about it, I felt a little less
                shame about what I had, I felt like I was taking ownership of it.
            </p>

            <p>Then my luck changed. I started a new medication and started seeing my college
                psychologist for guidance and counselling. Soon I was feeling a lot better.
                Now I’m quite well although I still get nervous with people. It takes a long time
                for your self-esteem to grow.
            </p>

            <p>
                For Time to Talk Day, I’d encourage everyone to have a conversation – even just ask a friend how they
                are. If you notice someone who's maybe cancelling plans a bit more, maybe you'll notice slight
                differences in them – quite often, there's a lot going on under the surface. I found it quite difficult
                to pluck up the courage to talk. So I’d really like people to take the opportunity to perhaps not just
                speak to others if you’re struggling, but speak to your friends if you think there's something wrong
                with them.”
            </p>

            <p>
                I have found that gratitude and generosity is a cure for me feeling miserable
                and small. I am beginning to like myself.

                Initially, I went to the doctor for my low and high moods, including
                hallucinations, delusions and suicidal thoughts. Going to the GP was daunting,
                but I found the doctor empathetic and professional. She called CAMHs and the
                reply was instant. I was contacted the next day and asked to come in the day after.
                Everything happened swiftly. I met a family therapist for my first session in
                which I gave information about my symptoms and what had happened to me. My next
                session was with a psychiatrist whom I then started to meet weekly, even though
                I was reluctant to talk. My psychiatrist was very helpful and compassionate, and
                seemed to care about me as a client. I regularly attended sessions in which we
                would discuss techniques and strategies, go through my thought processes in
                trying circumstances and discuss what was important to me. I was made to feel
                comfortable and secure, and never judged. I was very satisfied with how things
                were going. However, I do understand that friends who have gone through CAMHS
                have not been as lucky. I was told in all of my sessions where I could go for
                help, who I could talk to and I was given all the support I needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am still attending my fortnightly sessions. I have not yet received any
                medication, as they did want to put me on anti-depressants. However, they were
                worried about the potential increase of suicidal thoughts. They also wanted to
                put me on anti-psychotic medication, but, were reluctant because of my age. I
                have not received a diagnosis, but they are still investigating.
