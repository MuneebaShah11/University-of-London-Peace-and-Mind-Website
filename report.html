        <h1><b><u>REPORT</u></b></h1>
       <b>Muneeba Shah</b> 

<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<b>What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement?</b>
<p>My site “Peace and Mind” revolves around the theme of mental health. Through my website I have tried to highlight the importance of mental health, mental wellbeing and awareness regarding mental illnesses. I tried to provide relevant information , the significance of seeking help and also shared some personal stories of individuals who have gone through some kind of mental illness at some point in their lives. The website also highlights some causes that lead to mental illnesses and how being unhealthy at mind could affect one’s daily life.</p>
<p>
The first page <b>“Homepage”</b> gives an overview of the whole website. It has bits and pieces of content of all the other pages. <br>
The second page <b>“News and Articles”</b> shows news and articles regarding mental health. <br>
The third page <b>“Awareness”</b> displays shocking facts and figures about the mental health. It also highlights some mental illnesses, their symptoms, treatments and some ways to seek help. <br>
The fourth page <b>“Personal Stories”</b> tells the personal stories of individuals who have been through mental illness and how they overcame them. <br>
The last page is <b>“Need Help” </b>page which asks for the information of the person seeking any kind of help. <br> 
For implememting dark/light mode I have used global varibales and made a "root" div in the css <br>
Each of the page is accessible through the Navigation Bar. </p>

<p>The website has five webpages each of which has different type of content. I have used grid layout to structure the pages, using a separate div for each grid item. <br>
The website is made using Html , CSS and Javascript. The main page is structured in “index.html” and there are separate html files for each of the page. <br>
For styling there is a common CSS file.<br>
Interactivity is implemented through javascript. There are two javascript files which support different interactivities. One is for the slideshow on “Awareness” page which is the third page in the website and the other is to implement Dark Mode throughout the website.<br>
In order to make the website responsive I have used “Media queries”. Media queries define the page layout for tablet and mobile while the default code is for the laptop. </p>



<h1>Inspiration:</h1>
<b>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website (e.g. guest speakers, websites, artists, blogs).</b>

<p>Mental health is a concerning issue in the world these days. More and more people are going through some kind of problem related to mental health. Following things inspired me when I was creating my website.</p>
<ol>
<li>I came across a documentary<b> “My Mind & Me” </b> in which a famous singer <b>“Selena Gomez” </b> talks about mental health very openly and shares her own struggles. Watching this documentary and seeing a very famous artist spreading awareness regarding mental health problems, gave me inspiration to collect data and information about this topic on my own and make it a part of my website.</li> <br>

<li>The website <b> “Mind” </b> is a very powerful website that contains information and resources regarding mental health problems. It played a huge role in inspiring me while I was working on my website. The platform not only highlights the importance of mental health but also provides help in different ways to anyone going through any mental condition. </li> <br>

<li><b>“World mental health report” </b> by World Health Organization also helped me a lot in forming my website as this report contains extensive research on mental health and provides valuable insights and data on the topic. This report was very informative and sparked new ideas in my mind which I then implemented in my own website. </li>

</ol>

<h1>Accessibility:</h1>
<b>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</b>

<p>Accessibility is an important feature of any website. Making a website accessible attracts more and more people to the platform. While making this website I have considered applying accessibility in the following ways:</p>
<ol>


<li><b>Dark/Light Mode</b></li>
Dark and Light mode is an important feature for visually impaired individuals. Dark mode reduces the brightness of screens, reducing eye strain while light mode can make text more readable and provides clarity. Dark mode also reduces the battery consumption. Hence, having both features on the website allows users to select the mode of their own choice, according to their own accessiblity. <br>

<li><b>Keyboard Navigation</b></li>                               
According to Website Compliance Standards, making functionality available through keyboard is also an important accessibility feature. Keyboard navigation provides accessibility to people with disabilities and makes their experience much better on the website. My website allows users to navigate through keyboard without using mouse, the navigation is in logical order so the user can predict where the next tab will be. <br>

<li><b>Text Alternatives For Images</b></li>  
Providing alternative text for images is an accessible feature for people with visual impairments or for those who cannot see the images for various reasons such as slow internet connection. I have tried implementing alternative text for images so that they are more “perceivable”.
</ol>

<h1>Usability:</h1>
<b>State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site.</b>
<p>In order to make the website more user-friendly, usability features are a must to consider when designing the website. I have considered the usability of website in order to attract more users in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Clear Navigation</b></li> 
Navigation bar is a significant part of any website that allows users to navigate from one page to another. I have made a very clear navigation bar that is displayed on each page so that the user can jump from one page to any other page through the navigation bar. <br>

<li><b>Responsiveness</b></li>  
By adding media queries I have made my website usable on a number of devices , having different screen sizes such as mobile and tablet. Responsiveness makes the content of website accessible even if the window is resized ,preventing any kind of distortion, hence making it more usable for the users. <br>

<li><b>Clear Content</b></li> 
The website has different content on each of the page. The content is clear and a single page contains an optimum level of information, not being stuffed with too much content. 
Dark/Light mode features are also very much visible on each page. Also, the color contrast was kept into consideration to make the website user-friendly. The font size and line height are also chosen carefully to facilitate the users.<br>

</ol>

<h1>Learning:</h1>
<b>State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that?</b>
<p>Making a whole website by myself was a great learning experience for me. I learnt many new things and also tried implementing them in my website.</p> 
<ol>
<li><b>Grids</b></li>
This time I wanted to make my website in way that maintains its modularity and structure. Using grids was a great option to structure the content and promote alignment, making the website consistent. I had no prior experience in using grids, hence I had to learn understanding it. I learnt implementing grids from the Coursera videos and the South London Reading Club Website. It was very easy to understand grids from these sources.<br>

<li><b>Implementing Dark/Light mode</b></li> 
To make my website accessible I wanted to implement Dark mode in it. I learned about the implementation of dark/light mode using Javascript through the documentation provided at the website geeksforgeeks.org . It was not enough for me so I also watched YouTube video tutorials. The video that helped me learn and implement dark mode is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j_kBqpFK-g <br>

<li><b>CSS properties</b></li> 
There were many new CSS properties that I had to use in my website such as media queries, flex box, flex-wrap, vertical navigation bar, transform, creating a form through html and css etc. and W3Schools was great online learning source for me. The documentation and examples provided there made me learn new things very easily and effectively.

</ol>


<h1>Evaluation I:</h1>
<b>What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why?</b>
<p>The process of making the website was a long one, yet an amazing learning experience. I found out new things, learnt about them and contrary to the midterm project it is safe to say that I used far better techniques in structuring my website. Furthermore, making five pages helped me practice the new concepts that I learnt while making this website.</p>

<p>First of all, I think grids worked very well in my website. The type of structure that I wanted for my website, required using columns and I believe usinf grids was a very efficient approach to do so. Using grids allowed me to make as many columns as I wanted, and I could describe the width of each column, which proved very useful in aligning items in grid spaces the way I wanted them to be. </p>

<p>The use of transform and transition properties that I used when news and articles are hovered over was also a success. It gives a pleasing effect and works successfully throughout the website. Before using this property I took help from online sources and video tutorials to understand this css property of transform and translate. I then implemented it a number of times on the website and due to practice it was smooth implementation.</p>

<p>The dark/light mode also works in a successful manner. This feature not only implements the mode as chosen by user but also saves the user’s preference of dark or light mode and implement in on all the pages, even when the website is refreshed or opened after being closed. I used global variables and defined them in the :root div in CSS, which made the working of dark/light mode easy. </p>

<p>The Media Queries were also successful for the widths that I have defined. Again, since I had used grids in my website, implementing media queries was easy and successful. </p>

<p>The Responsive news blog section that I made in “News and Articles” was a success. I used flexbox to implement it so whenever the screen is resized it is not distorted but the flex-wrap property aligns each article in a vertical manner when the space is less. </p>

<p>Hence, using these techniques prevented my webpages from being distorted and kept the elements in their allocated spaces even if the screen is resized.</p>



 <h1>Evaluation II:</h1>
 <b>What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time?</b>

<p>I had some issues while making the footer for the website. Even though it looks fine I would like to make it better the next time. I am not very clear about the property to use to style different columns within a footer. I will make the footer much better by placing the items in more structured way such as equal spacing between columns, equal spacing from all the four sides and making sure the content within the footer is consistent throughout the webpages.</p>

<p>I also think I can make an improved navigation bar, a navigation bar that is sticky and does not disappear when the user scrolls down. </p>

<p>The webpage “Personal Stories” could have been improved and a different approach could be used to display the personal stories. If I were to make it again, I will make it in a way so that there is not so much text to read side by side. I will display half of the the story , and use “Read More” button to read full story only if the user is interested to read more. </p>

<p>I can also improve the media queries for the website and add more screen sizes to make it responsive for variety of devices. </p>

<p>In the page “Awareness” I have made a slideshow. I think the slideshow that I made could have been improved and made more interactive using javascript in a better way. I would make the slideshow more neat in its look and will make the transition from one slide to another more smooth. </p>
